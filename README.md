# FaceMaskDetection_Arduino-Python
Face mask detection(Webcam). Python code that interacts with an arduino board.
Face Detection used is from https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection.
Due to me not making this repository on time *RIP to my HDD :) *, I no longer have the python script.
I'll do my best to rewrite it ASAP, but until then, you can find snippets of it and some documentation on the .ino code:
